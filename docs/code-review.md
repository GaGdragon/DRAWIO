# Code Review Guidelines

## 1. Functionality

- Verify that the code implements the intended functionality and or fix the specific bug.
- Ensure that edge cases and possible error scenarios are handled appropriately.

    - Does the code implement the intended functionality?
    - Are all the requirements met?
    - Are edge cases and potential error scenarios handled appropriately?
    - Is the reason for the change valid?

## 2. Readability and Maintainability

- Check that the code is well-organized, easy to read, and follows established coding conventions.
- This includes proper indentation, consistent naming conventions, and appropriate use of comments to explain complex or non-obvious code segments.

    - Is the code well-organized and easy to read?
    - Are naming conventions consistent and descriptive?
    - Is the code properly indented and formatted?
    - Are comments used appropriately to explain complex or non-obvious code segments?

## 3. Code Structure and Design

- Evaluate whether the code is modular, adheres to established design patterns, and architectural guidelines:

    - Does the code follow established design patterns and architectural guidelines?
    - Is the code modular and maintainable?
    - Are functions and classes of reasonable size and complexity?
    - Does the code adhere to the principles of separation of concerns and single responsibility?

## 4. Performance and Efficiency

- Review the code for potential performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies, such as unnecessary loops, memory leaks, or suboptimal algorithms.

    - Are there any potential performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies?
    - Is memory usage optimized?
    - Are algorithms and data structures appropriate and efficient?
    - Are there any opportunities for caching or parallelization?

## 5. Error Handling and Logging

- Ensure that the code includes proper error handling and logging mechanisms to help with debugging and troubleshooting.

    - Does the code include proper error handling mechanisms?
    - Are exceptions used appropriately and caught at the correct level?
    - Is logging implemented for debugging and troubleshooting purposes?
    - Are error messages clear, descriptive, and actionable?

## 6. Security

- Verify that the code follows secure coding practices and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting, or improper access controls.

    - Does the code follow secure coding practices?
    - Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?
    - Is user input validated and sanitized properly?
    - Are authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented correctly?

## 7. Test Coverage

- Ensure that the tests are passing and up-to-date.

    - Does the code require appropriate unit tests or integration tests?
    - Do the core test still pass with the commit included?

## 8. Code Reuse and Dependencies

- Review the code for proper reuse of existing libraries, frameworks, or components, and ensure that any dependencies are managed correctly and up-to-date.

    - Is the code properly reusing existing libraries, frameworks, or components?
    - Are dependencies managed correctly and up-to-date?
    - Are any unnecessary dependencies or duplicate code segments removed?
    - Are dependencies secure, actively maintained, and of sufficient quality?

## 9. Compliance with Coding Standards

- Make sure that the code complies with any company or project-specific coding standards or guidelines.

    - Does the code comply with company or project-specific coding standards and guidelines?
    - Are any linters or static analysis tools used to enforce coding standards?

## 10. Documentation

- Confirm that the code includes sufficient documentation, such as inline comments, function or method descriptions, and high-level documentation for complex modules or components.

    - Are inline comments used effectively to explain complex or non-obvious code segments?
    - Do functions, methods, and classes have descriptive comments or docstrings?
    - Is there high-level documentation for complex modules or components?
    - Is documentation regularly updated?
